## The Problem (Agitate Pain Points)

### You Can't Trust Cloud Storage

❌ **Dropbox, Drive, and iCloud can read your files**
❌ **Data breaches expose your private photos and documents**
❌ **Government requests access your sensitive data**
❌ **No control over who sees your content**

### Current Solutions Are Broken

- **VeraCrypt**: Too complex for everyday use
- **Cryptomator**: No GPU acceleration, slow processing
- **Boxcryptor**: Closed-source, expensive ($120/year)
- **Native cloud encryption**: Provider holds the keys

---

## The Solution (Your Product)

✅ **Multi-cloud freedom** - One tool for S3, Drive, Dropbox
✅ **GPU-accelerated** - Process images 10x faster

## Objection Handling

### "Is it really secure?"
Yes. We use AES-256-GCM (same encryption NSA uses for top-secret data). All encryption happens on YOUR device BEFORE upload. Even we can't decrypt your files. The code is open source—audit it yourself.

### "Can I trust you with my data?"
We never see your data. Files are encrypted on your computer before upload. We don't have access to your encryption keys. This is "zero-knowledge" architecture—mathematically impossible for us to decrypt your files.

### "What if I lose my encryption key?"
Your encryption key is stored securely on your device. We recommend backing it up to a password manager. If you lose it, we CANNOT recover your files—this is by design for maximum security. Your data, your responsibility.

### "Is $199/year worth it?"
Compare alternatives:
- Dropbox Plus: $120/year (they can read your files)
- Boxcryptor: $120/year (closed source, no GPU)
- Building it yourself: 100+ hours of development

Secure Media Processor gives you military-grade security + GPU speed + multi-cloud + open source for $199/year. That's $16.58/month for peace of mind.

### "Can I try before buying?"
Yes! Download the free version and use local encryption unlimited. When you're ready for cloud storage and GPU acceleration, upgrade to Pro anytime.
